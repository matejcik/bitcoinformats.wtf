I originally intended to document Bitcoin's chronic inability to use a format designed
by someone else, or, $heavens forbid, introducing a code dependency. My goal is to tear
down the frankly insane BIP-174 custom format, which is actually protobuf in disguise,
but the devs don't want to admit that.

But that would take too long, and I have since worked on other cryptocurrencies and
found out that they're also full of WTFs. Surprise, surprise.

So this is a place for me to rant about them.
